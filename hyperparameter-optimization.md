I started by installing the metis turner by downloading a zip file from a URL which I unziped fro the content to download and install. That I run the code to check from
sanity check to make sure everything is working fine. After that I ran the models to test them out as well.
Metis tuner has a number of advantages over conventional tuning algorithms. While most programs merely estimate the ideal configuration, Metis provides two outputs: the optimal configuration prediction and a suggestion for the next experiment. There will be no more guesswork! While most tools presume that training datasets are free of noise, Metis really notifies you if you need to resample a certain hyper-parameter. While most tools suffer from exploitation-heavy difficulties, Metis' search technique balances exploration, exploitation, and resampling. Metis is a sequential model-based optimization (SMBO) technique that is built on the Bayesian Optimization framework. Metis use both a Gaussian Process and a GMM to represent the parameter-vs-performance space. Metis heavily exchanges inference calculations with na√Øve trials since each trial might incur a substantial time cost. Metis performs two jobs throughout each iteration: It locates the global best point in the Gaussian Process space. The ideal configuration is represented by this point. It finds the next candidate for a hyper-parameter. This is accomplished by calculating the possible information gain via exploration, exploitation, and resampling.
