## Milestone1 

###### First, I created a notebook in Collab and a repo on GitHub. Then I mounted the drive. Clone the files from the GitHub link I was provided with. Linked my GitHub to Collab and made a folder on My Dive named "Project". Then I move the files I copy from the provided GitHub link and create a new branch called "Milestone1". Did git add, commit, push to push branches to GitHub. To install NNI I follow the instruction given in the assignment.
