## Knowledge Distillation

Knowledge Distillation is more typically conducted on neural network models associated with complicated designs that include several layers and 
model parameters. As a result, with the emergence of deep learning over the previous decade and its success in a variety of domains like as speech 
recognition, picture identification, and natural language processing, knowledge distillation approaches have gained significance for practical 
real-world applications.

The difficulty of installing big deep neural network models is particularly relevant for edge devices with limited memory and processing capabilities. 
To address this issue, a model compression approach was initially presented in order to transfer information from a big model into training a smaller 
model without substantial performance loss. Hinton and colleagues codified this process of learning a tiny model from a bigger model as a "Knowledge 
Distillation" framework.

Knowledge in a neural network often refers to the learnt weights and biases. At the same time, the sources of information in a big deep neural network 
are diverse. The logits are commonly used as the source of teacher information in knowledge distillation, whereas others rely on the weights or 
activations of intermediary layers. Other crucial knowledge includes the association between various sorts of activations and neurons, as well as 
the parameters of the instructor model itself. Knowledge is classified into three types: response-based knowledge, feature-based information, and 
relationship-based knowledge. Figure 2 depicts the three forms of knowledge from the teacher model. In the next part, I will go through each of these 
major information sources in depth.

The woven sash is arguably the most well-known and well recognized emblem linked with Métis culture. The sash was admired for both its aesthetic 
prominence and its functionality and adaptability. A beautiful beaded pipe bag was frequently hanging from a Voyageurs sash. It was also utilized 
by Voyageurs to carry their things while on the road, and it offered warmth throughout the colder seasons.

The fiddle has figured prominently in the lifestyle of the Métis people for hundreds of years. The famous Red River jig has become the centerpiece 
of Métis music, although it varies by region and performer. Since the European fiddle was very expensive in Canada’s early development as a country, 
may craftsmen learned to make their own. Today, the fiddle is used in celebrations and fiddle and jigging contests, where the fiddle symbolizes 
nationhood and pride.
